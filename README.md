## 🔬 Workflow Pipeline

1️⃣ **Data Cleaning**  
• Handle missing values (e.g., 'transferred' column)  
• Consistent datatypes

2️⃣ **Feature Engineering**  
• Extract temporal features (week, weekday, weekend)  
• Encode categorical features (Label Encoding + OneHotEncoding)

3️⃣ **Model Training**  
• Train/Test split  
• Linear Regression  

4️⃣ **Evaluation**  
• MAE, MSE, R² Score  
• Scatter Plot for actual vs predicted sales

## 📊 Model Performance

| Model | R² Score |
|-------|----------|
| Linear Regression | ~ 0.59 |
